Connect to the server, create a room, wait for others to join and let the planning begin!

In the current version the creator of the room is it's only admin by default. The admin requests for estimates for given task, then all the users (including admin) can send thier estimates. Only admin can see estimates all the time, 'regular roomie' has to estimate first in order to see others estimates.
